# Matching a URL using Regular Expressions

A regular expression, or regex, is a sequence of characters that allows you to create patterns to search for in text. This tutorial explains how to search for a url using a regex.

## Summary

The regex used to search for a url in is as follows:
`/^(https?:\/\/)?([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})([\/\w \.-]*)*\/?$/`
Each character is in a specific order and combined with other characters to search exclusively for valid urls. In the following tutorial, I will explain the significance of each character and its placement in the regex.
